Crust is a Minecraft Layer 7 Reverse Proxy that aims for pure performance and rich features

The software is written in Rust only and in an early development stage.
We are currently support all minecraft protocols after 1_20_1 (With the new config state)

Latest build can be obtained here https://ci.outfluencer.dev/job/Crust/lastSuccessfulBuild/

The config should speak for its own for now
